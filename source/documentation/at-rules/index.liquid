title: At-Rules
introduction: >
  Much of Sassâ€™s extra functionality comes in the form of new
  [at-rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule) it adds
  on top of CSS:
---

{% markdown %}
* [`@use`](./use) loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass
  stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together.

* [`@forward`](./forward) loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins,
  functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the `@use`
  rule.

* [`@import`](./import) extends the CSS at-rule to load styles, mixins,
  functions, and variables from other stylesheets.

* [`@mixin` and `@include`](./mixin) makes it easy to re-use chunks of
  styles.

* [`@function`](./function) defines custom functions that can be used in
  [SassScript expressions][].

* [`@extend`](./extend) allows selectors to inherit styles from one
  another.

* [`@at-root`](./at-root) puts styles within it at the root of the
  CSS document.

* [`@error`](./error) causes compilation to fail with an error message.

* [`@warn`](./warn) prints a warning without stopping compilation
  entirely.

* [`@debug`](./debug) prints a message for debugging purposes.

* Flow control rules like [`@if`][], [`@each`][], [`@for`][], and [`@while`][]
  control whether or how many times styles are emitted.

[SassScript expressions]: ../syntax/structure#expressions
[`@if`]: ./control/if
[`@each`]: ./control/each
[`@for`]: ./control/for
[`@while`]: ./control/while

Sass also has some special behavior for [plain CSS at-rules][]: they can contain
[interpolation][], and they can be nested in style rules. Some of them, like
[`@media`][] and [`@supports`][], also allow SassScript to be used directly in
the rule itself without interpolation.

[plain CSS at-rules]: ./css
[interpolation]: ../interpolation
[`@media`]: ./css#media
[`@supports`]: ./css#supports
