  Ideally this would use named args, but that's not supported yet:
  https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/2679

  In the meantime, the args are (in order): `dart`, `libsass`, `ruby`, `feature`

  Only Dart Sass currently supports `@use`. Users of other implementations must
  use the [`@import` rule][] instead.
