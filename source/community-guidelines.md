title: 'Community Guidelines'
introduction: >
  Sass is more than a technology; Sass is driven by the community of individuals
  that power its development and use every day. As a community, we want to
  embrace the very differences that have made our collaboration so powerful, and
  work together to provide the best environment for learning, growing, and
  sharing of ideas. It is imperative that we keep Sass a fun, welcoming,
  challenging, and fair place to play.

  ### License

  Our friends at [Ubuntu][] and [Drupal][] have already worked hard to develop
  their own community guidelines, and we borrow heavily from them. However, we
  have made modifications for our specific needs as a community.

  The Sass Community Guidelines are licensed under the [Creative Commons
  Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license][cc]. You may re-use it for your own
  project, and modify it as you wish; just please allow others to use your
  modifications and give credit to Sass, [Ubuntu][] and [Drupal][].

  ### Adherence to these Community Guidelines

  We ask that all in-person and virtual gatherings of the Sass Community
  adhere to this code of conduct and take appropriate steps to create a safe
  and accessible space for all attendees. This should include the publication
  of a Code of Conduct that includes clear anti-harassment procedures. Please
  consult with us if you feel the need to significantly deviate from these
  guidelines by sending an email to:

  [sass.organizers@gmail.com](mailto:sass.organizers@gmail.com)

  We understand and acknowledge that the "Sass Community" is a loosely defined
  group of people who identify as Sass enthusiasts. We have no power to
  actively remove someone from the community. Ultimately, we can only use our
  voice to publicly declare that we do not agree with or endorse people or
  organizations who don't act in the spirit of these guidelines.

As such, the Sass Community Guidelines states our ideals as a community. It's
meant to be a guide on how we work together and conduct ourselves, not a
specific rulebook. It is a way to communicate our existing values to the
entire community, and share our values with the ‘verse.

## We strive to:

### Be considerate

Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work
of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we
should consider them when making decisions.

### Be open and inviting

Our community has grown immensely because of the diversity that is found
within the community. We welcome all individuals regardless of, but not
limited to, their gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
preferred relationship model, disability, physical appearance, body size, age,
race, or religious affiliation. We take pride in the the richness of
experiences that have come to help develop Sass, and want to continue growing
our community. In short, **everyone is welcome, except those who are
unwelcoming**.

### Be respectful

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve
conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathetic
fashion. We treat those who don’t use Sass with respect; they understand
their own needs better than anyone else. We don't allow frustration to
turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable
or threatened is not a productive one. **Harassment of anyone, either
within the Sass community or outside of it, is never okay**.

### Take responsibility for our words and our actions

We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and
work to right the wrong.

### Be collaborative

What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts; it is the sum of many
dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision
is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part
must make an effort to understand the whole.

Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible,
we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free software
community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and
involve interested parties as early as possible.

### Value decisiveness, clarity and open communication

Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to
persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.

We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively.
When they cannot, we escalate the matter to either designated leaders at the
event or within the community to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.

### Be responsive and helpful

All of us started as new and inexperienced. Even the most experienced of us
may forget things. Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community.
Questions are encouraged and those who are asked should endeavor to be
responsive, courteous, and helpful. When off topic, please direct to the
appropriate forum. Even when the question is common and repeatedly asked, even
when the documentation explains it, remember that they have only asked it once
and they may have read, but not understood. Ultimately, it is better to give
no answer than an unfriendly one.

### Step down considerately

When somebody leaves or disengages from the community, we ask that they do so
in a way that minimizes disruption to the projects using their published work.
They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure
that others can pick up where they left off.
